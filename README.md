# I am Rich (UIKit)

This is my very first iOS app built while learning Swift and UIKit — a recreation of the classic "I Am Rich" beginner project ✨

## Overview
The app is intentionally simple: it displays a single screen with a label/image.  
It doesn’t do much, but it marks the starting point of my iOS development journey.

## Tech Stack

- **UI Framework:** UIKit (Storyboard)  
- **Minimum iOS Version:** 13.0+
